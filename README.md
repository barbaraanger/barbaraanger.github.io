## Introduction
Started as a 8-year-old girl who wanted to create a blog, because of that, I learned frontend development when HTML4 was still in use. After I started college, I was able to get more opportunities of development, in 2018 I started on my first internship on development, applying everything I learned over the years.

Today I am 3 years at Thoughtworks, where I am constantly learning about delivering value and optimizing development, with the best quality possible. 

## Why
A developer who aims to not only improve on engineering software with quality, but someone who wants to share that knowledge with other people.
